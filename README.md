# nmapauto.sh

Small script to automate port recognition with Nmap.
Remember to give it execution permissions to run it: chmod +x nmapauto.sh
The script requires privileges to be used.

USE:
Automatically scans the network and finds the IP of the victim machine to perform port reconnaissance (for VirtualBox machines):
./nmapauto.sh

On the other hand, if we need to specify the IP:
./nmapauto.sh "Enter the IP"
